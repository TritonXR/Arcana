# Arcana

A VR game where the player is a wizard, trying to navigate through a castle. The player will have to use their spells to solve fairly intricate, puzzling blockades. Who is trying so hard to keep them out?

(We donâ€™t know what the plot is yet.)

This game is great for VR because it makes the player feel like a wizard when waving around the wand (controller). The atmosphere of the game would also be more engaging in VR. Aimed toward anyone who loves puzzles and are wizards at heart.
